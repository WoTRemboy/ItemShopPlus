## Technologies üíª

### iOS Frameworks and Languages
- **Swift:** The primary language used to build the entire app, offering safety, performance, and modern language features.
- **SwiftUI:** It powers the layout and rendering of UI components, including widgets, and onboarding screens.
- **UIKit:** Used alongside SwiftUI for more complex or custom UI elements like UICollectionView, animations, and legacy components.
- **Core Data:** Responsible for local data persistence. It stores information about favorite items, user preferences, and cached shop data.
- **Combine:** A framework used for handling asynchronous programming in a reactive way (used with SwiftUI). It manages network requests, data flow, and UI updates seamlessly.

### Networking and Data Handling
- **URLSession:** The primary tool for managing network requests and fetching data from external APIs (like game item information, shop updates).
- **Kingfisher:** A third-party library used to efficiently download and cache images in the app, such as item images and in-game assets.
- **Yandex Ads SDK:** Integrated for serving advertisements to monetize the app. This includes displaying in-app ads to the users.

### User Interface and Experience
- **WidgetKit:** Powers the `Day Offer` widget, allowing users to see the latest shop items and updates directly from their home screen.
- **Core Animation:** Used to create smooth animations and transitions within the app, particularly for enhancing user interactions with buttons and other UI components.

### Push Notifications
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM):** Is used to send push notifications to users, such as alerts about new shop items, upcoming events, or important in-game updates.
- **Notification Service Extension:** Is implemented to customize notifications when they arrive on the device. This allows to modify the notification content dynamically, such as translating it based on the user‚Äôs preferred language.
- **Localized Notifications** The app uses the user‚Äôs language preference (stored in UserDefaults) to localize the notification text. When a notification is received, the app fetches the relevant localized message from the notification payload and displays it in the appropriate language.

### Logging
- **OSLog:** Integrated for logging essential app data, system events, and debugging information, making it easier to track performance and bugs.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è
The **ItemShopPlus** app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern in its UIKit components.
This pattern organizes the app‚Äôs structure, dividing it into three distinct layers:

### Model
The Model represents the data layer of the app. This includes all the logic related to data retrieval, manipulation, and storage.

Examples:
- `ShopItem`: Stores data for items in the shop, such as price, rarity, and availability.
- `GrantedShopItem`: Handles details about bonuses or special rewards.

### View
The View is responsible for displaying the user interface elements. It presents the data from the model to the user.
Views are passive; they do not contain any logic beyond what is required to display the data.

Examples:
- `CollectionTotalPriceView`: Displays total prices in details pages.
- `TimerRemainingView`: Shows countdowns in items shop and battle pass info pages.

### Controller
The Controller acts as the intermediary between the model and the view. It manages user interactions and updates both the model and view as necessary.
It also handles user input and interactions like button taps, data fetching, and updating the views.

Examples:
- `FavouritesItemsViewController`: Handles interactions with favorite items, allowing users to toggle and view their favorite shop items.
- `ShopViewController`: Manages the display of the shop page, handling user navigation and data presentation.

## Testing üß™

### Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on verifying the functionality of individual classes, methods, and functions in isolation.
Unit tests are written for both models and utility methods.

**ShopModelTests:** Tests for validating the correct behavior of the ShopItem, GrantedItem, and related entities. Ensures that properties such as item ID, name, and prices are correctly set and handled.
Example:
- `testEmptyShopItem()`: Verifies that a default, empty ShopItem is properly initialized with default values.

**StatsModelTests:** Tests for Stats and related classes, focusing on ensuring correct calculations of statistics such as `sumTopOne()` and `averageKD()`.
Example:
- `testAverageKDGlobal()`: Verifies the calculation of the average kill/death ratio for global stats.

### UI Testing
UI testing ensures that the user interface behaves correctly when interacted with. It simulates user actions such as tapping buttons, navigating screens, and entering text, then verifies the expected outcome.

**OnboardingScreenUITests:** Ensures that the onboarding screens function correctly, verifying that users can either skip or walk through the onboarding flow.
Example:
- `testOnbordingScreenWalkthrough()`: Simulates a user going through the onboarding screens, ensuring each page is correctly displayed and transitions work as expected.

**ShopPageUITests:** Tests the functionality of the shop page, ensuring that users can view item details, interact with banners, and see correct item pricing.
Example:
- `testShopPageInfoStruct()`: Simulates interaction with the shop page and verifies that essential information such as item details and pricing is presented correctly.

**BattlePassUITests:** Tests the navigation and interactions in the Battle Pass module, ensuring that users can view battle pass details and navigate between screens.
Example:
- `testBattlePassInfoStruct()`: Simulates user navigation to the Battle Pass screen and verifies that the correct information (e.g., start date, end date) is displayed.

## Documentation üìö
All significant classes, methods, and properties in the ItemShopPlus project are documented using Apple‚Äôs standard DocC format.
This format generates human-readable documentation directly from the source code, making it easy for developers to navigate through the project.

The documentation typically follows this structure:
- **Description:** Explains the purpose and functionality of the method/class.
- **Parameters:** Each parameter is documented, explaining what it represents and how it impacts the method.
- **Returns:** Where applicable, details what the method returns and under what conditions.

Every class includes a summary of its purpose, where and how it is used in the app, and detailed documentation of its methods and properties.
Example:
```swift
/// Downloads the image for a given `WidgetShopItem`
/// - Parameters:
///   - item: The `WidgetShopItem` that contains the image URL to be downloaded
///   - completion: A closure that returns the downloaded `UIImage` or `nil` if the download fails
///
/// The image is downloaded asynchronously, and the result is returned in the closure
private func downloadImage(for item: WidgetShopItem, completion: @escaping (UIImage?) -> Void) {
    // Code implementation
}
```
